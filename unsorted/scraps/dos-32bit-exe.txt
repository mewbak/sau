To load a 32-bit DOS extended executable into a disassembler
1. open such executable in hex-editor, and look for the next MZ (it will be followed by relocation table with a lot of zeroes)
2. delete everything before this point
3. save executable
4. open it in disassembler as usual.

otherwise you will see only a lot of DOS extender related crud.
